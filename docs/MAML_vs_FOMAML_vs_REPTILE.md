# Meta-Learning Algorithms Guide: MAML, FOMAML, and Reptile

This guide provides a comprehensive comparison of three meta-learning algorithms implemented in this repository: MAML, FOMAML, and Reptile.

## Overview

All three algorithms learn an initialization of model parameters that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal gradient steps. The key difference lies in how the meta-update is computed.

### MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)
- **Type:** Second-order meta-learning
- **Meta-update:** Gradient-based through inner loop
- **Pros:** Most accurate, theoretically sound
- **Cons:** Slowest, most memory-intensive

### FOMAML (First-Order MAML)
- **Type:** First-order meta-learning
- **Meta-update:** Gradient-based at adapted parameters only
- **Pros:** Good balance of speed and accuracy
- **Cons:** Slightly less accurate than MAML

### Reptile
- **Type:** Zero-order meta-learning
- **Meta-update:** Parameter interpolation
- **Pros:** Fastest, most stable, easiest to tune
- **Cons:** Slightly less accurate than MAML

## Algorithm Comparison

| Feature | MAML | FOMAML | Reptile |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| **Gradient Order** | Second-order | First-order | Zero-order (no gradients) |
| **Training Speed** | 1.0x (baseline) | ~1.4x faster | ~1.6x faster |
| **Memory Usage** | 1.0x (baseline) | ~0.5x less | ~0.4x less |
| **Relative Accuracy** | 100% (best) | 97-99% | 97-99% |
| **Stability** | Medium | Medium | High (most stable) |
| **Ease of Tuning** | Hard | Medium | Easy (most forgiving) |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Complex | Medium | Simple |

## Pseudo-Code Comparison

### MAML Pseudo-Code
```python
Initialize θ (meta-parameters)

For each meta-iteration:
    Sample batch of tasks {τᵢ}
    
    For each task τᵢ:
        θ'ᵢ = θ  # Copy initial parameters
        
        # Inner loop: Task adaptation
        For k steps:
            Compute loss L on support set with θ'ᵢ
            θ'ᵢ = θ'ᵢ - α∇L(θ'ᵢ)  # Inner update
        
        # Outer loop: Evaluate on query set
        Compute loss L_query(θ'ᵢ) on query set
    
    # Meta-update: Backpropagate THROUGH inner loop
    θ = θ - β∇_θ Σᵢ L_query(θ'ᵢ)  # Second-order gradients!
```

**Key Point:** MAML computes gradients with respect to the **original parameters θ**, requiring backpropagation through the entire inner loop adaptation process.

### FOMAML Pseudo-Code
```python
Initialize θ (meta-parameters)

For each meta-iteration:
    Sample batch of tasks {τᵢ}
    
    For each task τᵢ:
        θ'ᵢ = θ  # Copy initial parameters
        
        # Inner loop: Same as MAML
        For k steps:
            Compute loss L on support set with θ'ᵢ
            θ'ᵢ = θ'ᵢ - α∇L(θ'ᵢ)  # Inner update
        
        # DETACH θ'ᵢ from computational graph!
        θ'ᵢ = θ'ᵢ.detach().requires_grad_(True)
        
        # Outer loop: Evaluate on query set
        Compute loss L_query(θ'ᵢ) on query set
        
        # Compute gradients at θ'ᵢ only (not through inner loop)
        gᵢ = ∇_θ' L_query(θ'ᵢ)
    
    # Meta-update: Use gradients from adapted parameters
    θ = θ - β·mean(gᵢ)  # First-order approximation
```

**Key Point:** FOMAML computes gradients with respect to the **adapted parameters θ'**, ignoring the dependency of θ' on θ. This is the first-order approximation.

### Reptile Pseudo-Code
```python
Initialize θ (meta-parameters)

For each meta-iteration:
    Sample batch of tasks {τᵢ}
    
    For each task τᵢ:
        θ'ᵢ = θ  # Copy initial parameters
        
        # Inner loop: Same as MAML and FOMAML
        For k steps:
            Compute loss L on support set with θ'ᵢ
            θ'ᵢ = θ'ᵢ - α∇L(θ'ᵢ)  # Inner update
        
        # NO gradient computation needed!
    
    # Meta-update: Simple interpolation toward adapted parameters
    θ = θ + ε·mean(θ'ᵢ - θ)  # Parameter interpolation
```

**Key Point:** Reptile does NOT compute any gradients from the adapted parameters. It simply moves the meta-parameters toward the adapted parameters using interpolation.

## Mathematical Formulation

### MAML
The meta-objective is:
```
min_θ Σᵢ L_τᵢ(θ - α∇L_τᵢ(θ))
```

Meta-gradient:
```
∇_θ L_τᵢ(θ') = ∇_θ' L_τᵢ(θ') · ∇_θ θ'
                ↑                    ↑
          first term          second term
          (query loss)    (inner loop Jacobian)
```

The second term requires computing the Jacobian of the inner loop, which involves second-order derivatives.

### FOMAML
First-order approximation:
```
∇_θ L_τᵢ(θ') ≈ ∇_θ' L_τᵢ(θ')
```

FOMAML ignores the second term (∇_θ θ'), treating θ' as independent of θ. This eliminates the need for second-order gradients.

### Reptile
The meta-update is:
```
θ ← θ + ε(θ' - θ)
```

Which is equivalent to:
```
θ ← (1 - ε)θ + ε·θ'
```

This is an exponential moving average (EMA) toward the adapted parameters. Surprisingly, this simple update is theoretically justified as approximating the MAML gradient in expectation!

**Theoretical Connection:**
Under certain conditions, the expected Reptile update approximates the expected MAML gradient:
```
E[θ' - θ] ≈ E[∇_θ L_τ(θ')]
```

## When to Use Each Algorithm

### Use MAML when:
- ✅ Maximum accuracy is critical
- ✅ You have sufficient computational resources
- ✅ Model size is small to medium
- ✅ You need theoretical guarantees
- ❌ NOT recommended for: Large models, limited GPU memory, rapid prototyping

**Example Use Cases:**
- Research papers requiring state-of-the-art results
- Small-scale few-shot classification (Omniglot, Mini-ImageNet)
- Applications where 1-2% accuracy improvement matters

### Use FOMAML when:
- ✅ You need a good balance of speed and accuracy
- ✅ GPU memory is limited
- ✅ Model size is medium to large
- ✅ Slightly lower accuracy is acceptable
- ❌ NOT recommended for: Maximum accuracy requirements, ultra-fast prototyping

**Example Use Cases:**
- Production meta-learning systems
- Medium-scale few-shot learning
- When MAML is too slow but Reptile isn't accurate enough

### Use Reptile when:
- ✅ Training stability is important
- ✅ Fastest training is needed
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning is difficult
- ✅ You want to prototype quickly
- ✅ Resource constraints are severe
- ❌ NOT recommended for: Maximum accuracy requirements

**Example Use Cases:**
- Initial experiments and prototyping
- Large-scale meta-learning (many tasks)
- Continual learning scenarios
- On-device learning with limited compute

## Computational Complexity

### Time Complexity (per meta-iteration)

| Algorithm | Inner Loop | Outer Loop | Total |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| MAML | O(K·P) | O(K·P·B) | O(K·P·B) |
| FOMAML | O(K·P) | O(P·B) | O(K·P·B) |
| Reptile | O(K·P) | O(P·B) | O(K·P·B) |

Where:
- K = number of inner steps
- P = number of parameters
- B = batch size (number of tasks)

**Note:** Although asymptotic complexity is similar, the constant factors differ significantly:
- MAML: Highest constant (second-order operations)
- FOMAML: Medium constant (first-order operations)
- Reptile: Lowest constant (no gradient computation in outer loop)

### Memory Complexity

| Algorithm | Memory Usage | Reason |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| MAML | O(K·P·B) | Must store full computational graph |
| FOMAML | O(P·B) | Only stores adapted parameters |
| Reptile | O(P·B) | Only stores adapted parameters |

**Practical Memory Savings:**
- FOMAML: ~50% less memory than MAML
- Reptile: ~60% less memory than MAML

## Hyperparameter Recommendations

### MAML
```python
inner_lr = 0.01          # Inner loop learning rate
outer_lr = 0.001         # Meta-learning rate
inner_steps = 5          # Number of adaptation steps
optimizer = Adam         # Meta-optimizer
batch_size = 4-16        # Tasks per batch
```

**Tuning Tips:**
- Start with `inner_lr = 0.01` and adjust if adaptation is too slow/fast
- Keep `outer_lr` small (0.0001 - 0.01) for stability
- More `inner_steps` → better task performance but slower training
- Use gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0) for stability

### FOMAML
```python
inner_lr = 0.01          # Same as MAML
outer_lr = 0.001         # Same as MAML
inner_steps = 5          # Same as MAML
optimizer = Adam         # Same as MAML
batch_size = 4-16        # Same as MAML
```

**Tuning Tips:**
- Use the same hyperparameters as MAML
- FOMAML is less sensitive to hyperparameters than MAML
- Can sometimes use slightly higher `outer_lr` than MAML

### Reptile
```python
inner_lr = 0.01          # Same as MAML/FOMAML
outer_lr = 0.1           # ⚠️ MUCH LARGER than MAML!
inner_steps = 5          # Same as MAML/FOMAML
optimizer = N/A          # Not used (direct parameter update)
batch_size = 4-16        # Same as MAML/FOMAML
```

**Important:** Reptile's `outer_lr` (ε) is an interpolation coefficient, not a gradient-based learning rate!

**Tuning Tips:**
- Start with `outer_lr = 0.1` and adjust based on convergence
- Valid range: `outer_lr ∈ [0.01, 1.0]`
  - Lower (0.01-0.05): More stable, slower convergence
  - Medium (0.1-0.3): Recommended starting point
  - Higher (0.5-1.0): Faster convergence, may be unstable
- Reptile is very forgiving to hyperparameter choices
- `inner_lr` and `inner_steps` work the same as MAML

## Implementation Details

### Key Code Differences

#### MAML Inner Loop
```python
# create_graph=True enables second-order gradients
grads = torch.autograd.grad(
    loss,
    fast_weights.values(),
    create_graph=True  # ← Key difference!
)
```

#### FOMAML Inner Loop
```python
# create_graph=False disables second-order gradients
grads = torch.autograd.grad(
    loss,
    fast_weights.values(),
    create_graph=False  # ← First-order approximation
)

# Later: Detach adapted parameters
fast_weights = {name: param.detach().requires_grad_(True)
                for name, param in fast_weights.items()}
```

#### Reptile Meta-Update
```python
# No optimizer needed - direct parameter interpolation!
with torch.no_grad():
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        avg_adapted = adapted_params_sum[name] / batch_size
        # θ = θ + ε·(θ' - θ)
        param.data.add_(
            avg_adapted - original_params[name],
            alpha=outer_lr  # ε (interpolation strength)
        )
```

import torch.optim as optim

# Full second-order MAML
model, maml, losses = train_maml(
    model,
    task_dataloader,
    inner_lr=0.01,

    optimizer_cls=optim.Adam
)
```

model, reptile, losses = train_maml(
    model,
    task_dataloader,
    inner_lr=0.01,
    outer_lr=0.1,  # ⚠️ Note: 100x larger than MAML!
    inner_steps=5,
    algorithm='reptile'  # ← Specify Reptile
)
```

### Testing / Adaptation

predictions = maml.forward_with_weights(query_data, adapted_params)
```

## Common Pitfalls

### MAML
- ❌ Out of memory errors → Reduce batch size or use FOMAML/Reptile
- ❌ Very slow training → Expected! Consider FOMAML/Reptile
- ❌ Exploding gradients → Use gradient clipping (already implemented)

### FOMAML
- ❌ Forgetting to detach adapted parameters → Use `algorithm='fomaml'`
- ❌ Using `create_graph=True` → Should be `False` for FOMAML

### Reptile
- ❌ Using too small `outer_lr` (e.g., 0.001) → Should be ~0.1
- ❌ Using a meta-optimizer → Reptile doesn't use one!
- ❌ Expecting same hyperparameters as MAML → `outer_lr` is different!

## FAQ

**Q: Which algorithm should I use?**
A: Start with Reptile for prototyping (fastest, most stable). Use FOMAML for production (good balance). Use MAML only if you need maximum accuracy.

**Q: Why is Reptile's outer_lr so much larger than MAML's?**
A: Reptile's `outer_lr` (ε) is an interpolation coefficient, not a gradient-based learning rate. It controls how much to move toward adapted parameters (0 = no movement, 1 = full movement).

**Q: Can I mix algorithms during training?**
A: No, you should stick with one algorithm. However, you can train with Reptile for speed, then fine-tune with MAML for accuracy.

**Q: Does Reptile compute gradients at all?**
A: Yes, but only for the inner loop (task adaptation). The outer loop (meta-update) uses no gradients - just parameter interpolation.

**Q: Which algorithm is most similar to fine-tuning?**
A: Reptile! It's essentially "learning to fine-tune" by averaging adapted parameters.

## Conclusion

All three algorithms are effective for meta-learning, with different trade-offs:

- **MAML**: Best accuracy, but slowest and most memory-intensive
- **FOMAML**: Good balance of speed and accuracy
- **Reptile**: Fastest and most stable, with competitive accuracy

For most applications, we recommend:
1. **Start with Reptile** for rapid prototyping and hyperparameter tuning
2. **Use FOMAML** for production deployments
3. **Use MAML** only when you need the absolute best accuracy

The implementation in this repository makes it easy to switch between algorithms with a single parameter change, allowing you to experiment and find the best option for your use case.
